A csv input of 101 rows of animals with 18 columns, 'zoo.data.csv', is converted to a boolean-containing csv, 'new.csv'.

The Lab2.pde file is in 'ready to run state' as long as the zoo.data.csv file is in the same 'data' folder as Lab2.pde. 

A header is also added to the file, describing each columns' information.

Only 3 columns are read in as string (1), int (13), and int (17) corresponding to animalname, legs, and type, respetively; all
other columns are read in as int and converted to booleans (true if 1, false if 0).
